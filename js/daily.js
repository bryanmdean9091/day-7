//Daily Challenge Day 7
// Write a function called fizzbuzz that will accept no arguments
// The goal of this function is to print out all numbers from 1 to 100 but with three exceptions:
// For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, console log "FizzBuzz"
// For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, console log "Fizz"
// For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, console log "Buzz"



for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { //created for loop that prints out No 1-100-i++ adds one number to thr previous
    // console.log(i)
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {// first IF statement checking divisibilty by both 3 & 5
        console.log('Fizzbuzz')// console logs Fizzbuzz if requirements met
    }
     if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 != 0) {// second IF statement-Only divisibility by 3 required
        console.log('Fizz')//console logs Fizz if requirements met
    }
    else if (i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 === 0) {//ELSE IF statement-only divisibility by 5 required
        console.log('Buzz')//console logs Buzz if requirements met
    }
    else console.log(i);//ELSE statement -console logs all numbers 1-100 not meeting above requirements
}
